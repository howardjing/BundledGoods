  <P> In order to calculate total values of given bundles, you will need two elements: 
  <b>value of single goods</b> <i>and</i> the <b>Bundle Effect</b> for joint purchases.
  <P>The value for single goods will be located in the instructions and in the Value Menu located 
   on the screen. We will call value as utility interchangeably. Here is an example of a Value Menu.
  <P>
  <%= image_tag("utility.png")%>
  <P>The "Bundle Effect" will be located in statement links which you can open and close 
  as shown below:
  <P>Here is an example of a statement link:
  <P><%= image_tag("'show' statement.png")%>
  <P>Here is an example of an open statement:
  <P><%= image_tag("open 'show' statement.png")%>
  <P>Each statement will contain it's own multiple ranging from -1 to 3. In the example above, the multiple for
  a bundle with goods 1 and 3 is <b>"+1."</b> Every combination of goods will be 
   given, even the every good statement, which will always be valued <b>+0</b>. 
  <P>Next to the statement links are the goods associated with that certain bundle. In the image above,
  that statement contains goods 1 and 3. If the statement contained goods 1, 3, and 4, the corresponding 
  group next to the statement would be "(1,3,4)".
  <P>
  	The Muliplier Effect will be a number equally distributed between -1 and 3 for each experiment. 
  	The Multiplier Effect of <b>"+0" </b> will be weighted slightly more as the every good statement will
  	always be "+0". Before each experiment, the distribution will be stated to you in the instructions.
  <P>You are free to open and close however many statements you would like before making a final choice. 
  There is no penalty for not opening all of the statements. The statements will also be randomly arranged. 
  <P>Statements are independent of all previous viewed statements. For example, a statement containing good 1 and good 2 <b>DOES NOT</b> affect 
  a statement containing good 1, good 2, and good 3. Interpret each statement independent of 
  any other statement you have viewed before or that you view in the future.
  <P>
  	For example, if you opened a statement containing Goods 1 and 2 as follows.
  <P>
  	<%= image_tag("statement1_2.png")%>
  <P>
  	It would <B>NOT</b> affect the statement displayed below containing Goods 1, 2, and 4.
  <P><%= image_tag("statement1_2_4.png")%>
