  <P> In order to calculate total values of given bundles, you will need two elements: 
  <b>value of single goods</b> <i>and</i> the <b>Bundle Effect</b> for joint purchases.
  <P>The value for single goods will be located in the Value Menu  
   on the screen. We will call value as utility interchangeably. Here is an example of a Value Menu.
     <P>
  <%= image_tag("utility.png")%>

  the value of the Combo Package will be the sum of all the individual values plus one.
