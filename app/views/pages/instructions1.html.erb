  <P> In order to calculate total values of given bundles, you will need two elements: 
  <b>value of single goods</b> <i>and</i> the <b>Bundle Effect</b> for joint purchases.
  <P>The value for single goods will be located in the Value Menu  
   on the screen. We will call value as utility interchangeably. Here is an example of a Value Menu.

  <%= image_tag("utility.png")%>
  <P>
  	The Values of single goods are equally distributed between a certain range. Values for each good
  	 will be randomly generated and uniformly distributed between the range of 0 to 2. Each good 
  	 has a one in three change of either being valued at 1, 2, or 3.
  <P>
  You will learn how to calculate valuations for bundles in the next screen.
