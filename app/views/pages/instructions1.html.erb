    In order to calculate total values of given bundles, you will need two elements: 
    <b>value of single goods</b> <i>and</i> the <b>Bundle Effect</b> for joint purchases.
  </p>
  <p>
    The "Bundle Effect" will be located in statement links which you can open and close 
    as shown below:
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is an example of a statement link:
    <div><%= image_tag("'show' statement.png")%></div>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is an example of an open statement:
    <div><%= image_tag("open 'show' statement.png")%></div>
  </p>
  <p>
    Each statement will contain it's own bundle effect ranging from -4 to 4. In the example above, the 
    bundle effect for a bundle with goods 1 and 4 is <b>"-2."</b> A positive bundle effect will have a 
    positive sign preceding it. For example, if the statement says you value the bundle positive 1 the 
    bundle effect would look like <b>"+1."</b> Every combination of goods will be given. The Bundle Effect 
    will be randomly generated and uniformly distributed between the range for each experiment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next to the statement links are the goods associated with that certain bundle. In the image above,
    that statement contains goods 1 and 4. If the statement contained goods 1, 3, and 4, the corresponding 
    group next to the statement would be "[1,3,4]".
  </p>
  <p>
    You are free to open and close however many statements you would like before making a final choice. 
    There is no penalty for not opening all of the statements. You may however only open one statement at a time.
  </p>
  <p>
  	It is important to understand how to calculate these bundle values correctly, as the final valuation 
  	of the bundle of your choosing will be the monetary reward you receive for the round.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The following tutorial will test if you fully understand how to calculate valuations given 
  	the statements and values of a given bundle. You will not be able to move forward unless 
  	you plug in the correct values.
