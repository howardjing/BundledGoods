   <P>Alongside the menu of choices and prices, there will be statements that you can open and close that affect the valuation of certain bundles. 
  <P>Here is an example of a statement link:
  <P><%= image_tag("'show' statement.png")%>
  <P>Here is an example of an open statement:
  <P><%= image_tag("open 'show' statement.png")%>
  <P>Next to the statement links are the goods associated with that certain bundle. In the image above,
  that statement contains goods 1 and 3. If the statement contained goods 1,3, and 4, the corresponding 
  group next to the statement would be "(1,3,4)".
  <P>You are free to open and close however many statements you would like before making a final choice. 
  There is no penalty for not opening all of the statements. The statements will also be randomly arranged. 
  <P>Statements are independent of all previous viewed statements. For example, a statement containing good 1 and good 2 <b>DOES NOT</b> affect 
  a statement containing good 1, good 2, and good 3. Interpret each statement independent of 
  any other statement you have viewed before or that you view in the future.
  <P>
  	For example, if you opened a statement containing Goods 1 and 2 as follows.
  <P>
  	<%= image_tag("statement1_2.png")%>
  <P>
  	It would <B>NOT</b> affect the statement displayed below containing Goods 1, 2, and 4.
  <P><%= image_tag("statement1_2_4.png")%>
