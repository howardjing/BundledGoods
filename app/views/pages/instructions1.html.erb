  <P> In order to calculate total values of given bundles, you will need two elements: 
  <b>value of single goods</b> <i>and</i> the <b>Multiplier</b> for joint purchases.
  <P>The value for single goods will be located in the instructions and on top of the 
  experiment screen as shown below, we will call value as utility interchangeably:
  <P>
  <%= image_tag("utility.png")%>
  <P>The "Multiplier Effect" will be located in statement links which you can open and close 
  as shown below:
  <P>Here is an example of a statement link:
  <P><%= image_tag("'show' statement.png")%>
  <P>Here is an example of an open statement:
  <P><%= image_tag("open 'show' statement.png")%>
  <P>Each statement will contain it's own multiple ranging from -1 to 3. In the example above, the multiple for
  a bundle with goods 1 and 3 is <b>"+1."</b> Every combination of goods will be 
   given, even the every good statement, which will always be valued <b>+0</b>. 
  <P>Next to the statement links are the goods associated with that certain bundle. In the image above,
  that statement contains goods 1 and 3. If the statement contained goods 1, 3, and 4, the corresponding 
  group next to the statement would be "(1,3,4)".
  <P>
  	The Muliplier Effect will be a number equally distributed between -1 and 3 for each experiment. 
  	The Multiplier Effect of <b>"+0" </b> will be weighted slightly more as the every good statement will
  	always be "+0". Here is a chart of the distribution of Multiplier Effects for each experiment. 
  <P>

  <P>You are free to open and close however many statements you would like before making a final choice. 
  There is no penalty for not opening all of the statements. The statements will also be randomly arranged. 
  <P>Statements are independent of all previous viewed statements. For example, a statement containing good 1 and good 2 <b>DOES NOT</b> affect 
  a statement containing good 1, good 2, and good 3. Interpret each statement independent of 
  any other statement you have viewed before or that you view in the future.
  <P>
  	For example, if you opened a statement containing Goods 1 and 2 as follows.
  <P>
  	<%= image_tag("statement1_2.png")%>
  <P>
  	It would <B>NOT</b> affect the statement displayed below containing Goods 1, 2, and 4.
  <P><%= image_tag("statement1_2_4.png")%>
