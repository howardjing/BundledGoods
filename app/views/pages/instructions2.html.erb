  	There are two main values that you must rely on to find your final valuation of 
  	bundles, the <b>Value of single goods</b> <i>and</i> the <b>Bundle Effect</b>.
  	These values are important in figuring out the final valuation 
  	of bundles which will translate directly to your monetary reward 
  	of your choice.
  <P>
  	The Bundle effects can be found in the statements, and as shown in the previous screen, the value of 
  	individual goods is found at in the Value Menu at the top of the experiment page for each experiment.
  <P>The "Bundle Effect" will be located in statement links which you can open and close 
  as shown below:
  <P>Here is an example of a statement link:
  <P><%= image_tag("'show' statement.png")%>
  <P>Here is an example of an open statement:
  <P><%= image_tag("open 'show' statement.png")%>
  <P>Each statement will contain it's own bundle effect ranging from -3 to 3. In the example above, the bundle effect for
  a bundle with goods 1 and 4 is <b>"1."</b> A negative bundle effect will have a negative sign preceding it. For example,
  if the statement says you value the bundle negative 1 the bundle effect would look like <b>"-1."</b> Every combination of goods will be 
   given.
  <P>Next to the statement links are the goods associated with that certain bundle. In the image above,
  that statement contains goods 1 and 4. If the statement contained goods 1, 3, and 4, the corresponding 
  group next to the statement would be "[1,3,4]".
  <P>
  	The Bundle Effect will be a number equally distributed between -3 and 3 for each experiment. The 
  	Bundle Effect will be randomly generated and uniformly distributed between the range for each experiment.
  <P>You are free to open and close however many statements you would like before making a final choice. 
  There is no penalty for not opening all of the statements.  
  <P>Statements are independent of all previous viewed statements. For example, a statement containing good 1 and good 2 <b>DOES NOT</b> affect 
  a statement containing good 1, good 2, and good 3. Interpret each statement independent of 
  any other statement you have viewed before or that you view in the future.
  <P>
  	For example, if you opened a statement containing Goods 1 and 2 as follows.
  <P>
  	<%= image_tag("statement1_2.png")%>
  <P>
  	It would <B>NOT</b> affect the statement displayed below containing Goods 1, 2, and 4.
  <P><%= image_tag("statement1_2_4.png")%>
  <P>
  	It is important to understand how to calculate these bundle values correctly, as the final valuation 
  	of the bundle of your choosing will be the monetary reward you receive for the round.
  <P>
  	The following tutorial will test if you fully understand how to calculate valuations given 
  	the statements and values of a given bundle. You will not be able to move forward unless 
  	you plug in the correct values.
