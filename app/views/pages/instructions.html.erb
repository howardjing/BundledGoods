  <P>You are taking part in an experiment where you will be presented with purchasing goods from a menu. A menu of prices will be offered alongside a menu of choices to choose whichever goods or “Bundle” you would like to purchase. You can only purchase one of each type, but you are free to purchase however many goods on the menu to create a “bundle” of your choice. A bundle will be defined as any number of goods, greater than one, taken from the single component menu and purchased together. A combo package price will be offered alongside the single good price menu.
  <P>The menu of prices will be arranged randomly on the screen.
  <P>The menu of choices will be presented of either purchasing the all inclusive combo package, or choosing goods from the single component menu. You are free to click on any of the choices at any point in time. Clicking on a choice from the single component once will select the good, and clicking on it again will deselect the good. 
  <P>Here is an example of a good that has been selected with the button checked:
  <P><%= image_tag("checked.png")%>
  <P>Here is an example of a good that has either been de-selected or not chosen at all with the button blank:
  <P> <%= image_tag("unchecked.png")%>
  <P>Once you have made your final choice, you may press the continue button to move onto the next experiment. 
  <P>Alongside the menu of choices and prices, there will be statements that you can open and close that affect the valuation of certain bundles. 
  <P>Here is an example of a statement link:
  <P><%= image_tag("'show' statement.png")%>
  <P>Here is an example of an open statement:
  <P><%= image_tag("open 'show' statement.png")%>
  <P>You are free to open and close however many statements you would like before making a final choice. There is no penalty for not opening all of the statements. The statements will also be randomly arranged. 
  <P>The Experiment is divided into seven sections, with each experiment presenting a different menu and statements. There will be an easy three good practice round to test if you fully understand the problem that is facing you. You will not be able to continue on until you make the correct choice that maximizes your utility. Hints and pointers will appear if you are not making the correct choice.
  <P>Experiments 1 and 2 will deal with a four and five good problem respectively, while Experiments 3 and 4 will deal with the four and five good problem, but provide you with formulas to calculate the values. Experiments 5 and 6 will be a timed trial similar to Experiment 1 and 2.
  In Experiment 5 and 6, a time picked at random between 1 and t seconds, which is described by 
  the graph below, will be randomly selected. Whatever option you have selected at that time 
  will be your final choice for that particular experiment. Therefore, it is in your best interest 
  to "choose as you go" in the sense that if you prefer a particular option more to the one you 
  have selected to change your selection. Experiment 5 and 6 will be different from the other 
  experiments as your final choice is not necessarily the choice you selected when you click "finish", 
  but the choice that you have selected at the randomly determined time. 
  <P>The time that is selected will be determined by drawing from a random integer number between
  1 and t seconds from the given distribution pictured below. The x axis is the possible times 
  with the probability of the time happening on appearing on the y axis. For example, there is a
  X percent chance that t_1 will be the time selected and a Y percent chance that t_2 will be the 
  time selected.

  <P>Before each experiment, there will be instructions on how to evaluate each bundle that will stay the same throughout the experiment. The only things that have been manipulated are the values of certain parameters. Feel free to use scratch paper as you perform calculations.
  <P>Your monetary reward depends directly on the choices you make. In addition to the flat show up fee, 
  you have the ability to either lose up to 60 cents or make up to two and a half dollars during each experiment. 
  Choices you made in the easy three good practice round will not be counted towards your final payment. The 
  collective sum of money earned will be rounded to the closest integer number for payment. This however should not 
  dissuade you to put in less effort. Your payment depends on the collective sum, so even small differences in each experiment 
  can result in large differences in final payments.
