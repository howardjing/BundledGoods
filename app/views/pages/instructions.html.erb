  <P>You are taking part in an experiment where you will be presented with purchasing goods from a menu. A menu of prices will be offered alongside a menu of choices to choose whichever goods or “Bundle” you would like to purchase. You can only purchase one of each type, but you are free to purchase however many goods on the menu to create a “bundle” of your choice. A bundle will be defined as any number of goods, greater than one, taken from the single component menu and purchased together. A combo package price will be offered alongside the single good price menu.
  <P>The menu of prices will be arranged randomly on the screen.
  <P>The menu of choices will be presented of either purchasing the all inclusive combo package, or choosing goods from the single component menu. You are free to click on any of the choices at any point in time. Clicking on a choice from the single component once will select the good, and clicking on it again will deselect the good. 
  <P>Here is an example of a good that has been selected with the button checked:
  <P><%= image_tag("checked.png")%>
  <P>Here is an example of a good that has either been de-selected or not chosen at all with the button blank:
  <P> <%= image_tag("unchecked.png")%>
  <P>Once you have made your final choice, you may press the "Next" button to move onto the next experiment.
