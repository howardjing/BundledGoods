  <P>The Experiment is divided into seven sections, with each experiment presenting a different menu and statements. There will be a three good practice round to test if you fully understand the problem that is facing you. You will not be able to continue on until you make the correct choice that maximizes your utility. 
  <P>Below is a table of characteristics of each experiment.
  <table class="table table-bordered">

  <P>The choice you have selected when the timer runs out will be your final choice. 
  You are free to use the whole alloted time, or to make a choice and move onto the next experiment 
  before the time runs out.
  <P>Before each experiment, there will be instructions similar to the instructions given 
  in the tutorials. Feel free to use scratch paper as you perform calculations.
  <P><b>Experiment 5 and 6 have special instructions before the experiment. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE 
  ATTEMPTING.</b>
  <P>Your monetary reward depends directly on the choices you make. In addition to the flat show up fee, 
  you have the ability to either lose 3 dollars or make up to 14 dollars during each experiment. 
  Choices you made in the three good practice round will not be counted towards your final payment. A reward you have chosen from 
  Experiments 1 through 6 will be chosen at random to be your payment. It is in your best interest to perform each experiment to the best 
  of your ability as each experiment has a one in six chance of being picked as your monetary reward.
